Transform the current teacher-focused platform into a comprehensive educational ecosystem serving teachers, students, and parents with distinct user experiences and functionalities.

## Current State Analysis

- Features emphasize teacher management tools (scheduling, analytics, group management)
- No student or parent-specific content or workflows
- Single authentication system without role-based routing

## Target User Personas

### 1. Teachers (Primary Users)
**Needs:**
- Complete course management
- Student progress tracking
- Revenue and analytics
- Content creation and sharing
- Communication with students/parents

### 2. Students (Secondary Users)
**Needs:**
- Access to course materials and homework
- View their progress and grades
- Session schedules and attendance
- Simple communication with teachers
- Payment status visibility

### 3. Parents (Tertiary Users)
**Needs:**
- Monitor child's progress and attendance
- View payment history and upcoming fees
- Communication with teachers
- Session schedules and updates
- Academic performance insights

## Platform Architecture Changes

### 1. Landing Page Transformation

#### Current Issues:
- Single "Se connecter" button leads to teacher login
- Content focuses only on teacher benefits
- No mention of student/parent access

#### Proposed Changes:

**Header Section:**
- Replace single login with role-based login options:
  - "Espace Enseignant" → /auth/teacher-login
  - "Espace Étudiant" → /student/login
  - "Espace Parent" → /parent/login
- Add role selector dropdown or separate buttons

**Hero Section:**
- Update main headline to be inclusive:
  - Current: "Gérez vos cours comme un professionnel"
  - New: "La plateforme éducative complète pour enseignants, étudiants et parents"

**Features Section:**
- Restructure features to show benefits for each user type:
  - **For Teachers:** Course management, analytics, student tracking
  - **For Students:** Access materials, track progress, view schedules
  - **For Parents:** Monitor progress, payment tracking, communication

**How It Works Section:**
- Create separate workflows for each user type:
  - **Teachers:** Sign up → Create groups → Manage courses
  - **Students:** Get credentials → Access materials → Track progress
  - **Parents:** Get access → Monitor child → Communicate with teachers

### 2. Authentication & Routing System
