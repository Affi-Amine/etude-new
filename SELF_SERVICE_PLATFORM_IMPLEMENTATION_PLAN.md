# Self-Service Platform Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan transforms our platform from teacher-managed authentication to a self-service model that reduces teacher workload while improving user experience for teachers, students, and parents.

## Core Philosophy
- **Zero Burden on Teachers**: No manual account creation or credential management
- **Self-Service Registration**: Users register themselves with minimal friction
- **Automatic Linking**: Smart systems connect users without manual intervention
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for smartphone usage (primary device for students/parents)
- **Minimal Complexity**: Each user type sees only what they need

## Phase 1: Database Schema Changes

### New Tables & Fields

#### 1. Group Invitation System
```sql
-- New table for group invitation codes
CREATE TABLE GroupInvitations (
  id String @id @default(cuid())
  groupId String
  inviteCode String @unique // 6-digit code
  qrCodeUrl String? // Generated QR code image URL
  expiresAt DateTime
  maxUses Int @default(50)
  currentUses Int @default(0)
  isActive Boolean @default(true)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  
  group Group @relation(fields: [groupId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
)
```

#### 2. Family Connections
```sql
-- New table for parent-student relationships
CREATE TABLE FamilyConnections (
  id String @id @default(cuid())
  studentId String
  parentId String
  familyCode String @unique // Student-generated code for parents
  relationship String // "parent", "guardian", etc.
  isVerified Boolean @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  
  student User @relation("StudentFamily", fields: [studentId], references: [id])
  parent User @relation("ParentFamily", fields: [parentId], references: [id])
)
```

#### 3. Enhanced User Model
```sql
-- Add to existing User model
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  
  // New fields for self-service
  phoneNumber String?
  isPhoneVerified Boolean @default(false)
  registrationSource String? // "invite_code", "qr_code", "family_code"
  onboardingCompleted Boolean @default(false)
  
  // Relations
  studentConnections FamilyConnections[] @relation("StudentFamily")
  parentConnections FamilyConnections[] @relation("ParentFamily")
}
```

#### 4. Student Profile Enhancements
```sql
-- Add to existing Student model
model Student {
  // ... existing fields
  
  familyCode String @unique // For parent registration
  allowParentAccess Boolean @default(true)
  parentNotifications Boolean @default(true)
}
```

## Phase 2: Authentication & Registration System

### 2.1 Group Invitation System

#### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Generate invitation for a group
POST /api/groups/[id]/invite
{
  expiresInDays: number,
  maxUses: number,
  generateQR: boolean
}

// Validate invitation code
GET /api/invitations/validate/[code]

// Register with invitation code
POST /api/auth/register-student
{
  inviteCode: string,
  name: string,
  email: string,
  phoneNumber: string,
  password: string
}
```

#### Teacher Dashboard Changes
- **Group Management**: Add "Invite Students" button to each group
- **Invitation Modal**: Generate codes, QR codes, set expiration
- **Student List**: Show registration status (pending/completed)
- **Bulk Actions**: Send reminders, regenerate codes

### 2.2 Student Self-Registration Flow

#### New Pages
1. **`/student/register`** - Main registration page
2. **`/student/register/[code]`** - Pre-filled with group info
3. **`/student/verify-phone`** - SMS verification
4. **`/student/onboarding`** - Welcome & setup

#### Registration Process
1. Student enters invite code OR scans QR
2. System validates code and shows group info
3. Student fills basic info (name, email, phone)
4. SMS verification for phone number
5. Password creation
6. Automatic group assignment
7. Welcome onboarding flow

### 2.3 Parent Access System

#### Family Code Generation
- Each student gets unique 8-character family code
- Displayed in student dashboard
- Can be regenerated if needed

#### Parent Registration Flow
1. **`/parent/register`** - Enter family code
2. System shows student name for verification
3. Parent enters their info
4. Student receives notification to approve
5. Parent gets access after approval

- **UI Improvements**: Enhanced dialog padding and spacing in GroupInvitationManager component
- **API Route Optimization**: Improved error handling and response formatting

### Key Considerations for Self-Service Implementation

#### 1. Group Creation Logic Changes
**Before**: Teachers required minimum student count to create groups
**After**: Groups can be created without students, then populated via invitation codes

**Impact**: 
- Simplified group creation workflow
- Enables "build it and they will come" approach
- Reduces teacher administrative overhead
- Allows for gradual student enrollment

#### 2. Student Onboarding Flow
**Before**: Manual student addition by teachers
**After**: Self-service registration via invitation codes

**Changes Required**:
- Remove minimum student validation from group creation
- Add invitation code validation in student registration
- Implement automatic group assignment upon successful registration
- Create welcome emails/notifications for new students

#### 3. Parent Access Model
**Before**: No parent portal access
**After**: Family-code based parent registration

**Implementation Notes**:
- Each student generates unique family codes
- Parents register independently using family codes
- Student approval required for parent access
- Secure parent-student relationship verification

#### 4. Payment System Adaptations
**Consideration**: With self-service registration, payment collection needs automation

**Required Changes**:
- Automatic payment schedule generation upon student enrollment
- Integration with payment gateways for self-service payments
- Automated payment reminders and notifications
- Parent access to payment history and outstanding balances

#### 5. Communication System Overhaul
**Before**: Direct teacher-student/parent communication
**After**: Platform-mediated communication with notifications

**Features Needed**:
- In-app messaging system
- Email/SMS notification preferences
- Automated progress reports
- Emergency communication channels

#### 6. Data Privacy & Security
**Enhanced Requirements**:
- GDPR compliance for self-registered users
- Parental consent mechanisms for minors
- Data retention policies for inactive accounts
- Secure family code generation and validation

#### 7. Mobile-First Considerations
**Critical for Success**:
- Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation
- Offline capability for core features
- Touch-optimized interfaces
- Push notification support

### Next Phase Priorities

1. **User Acceptance Testing**: Deploy to pilot group of teachers
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track invitation usage and conversion rates
3. **Feedback Integration**: Collect and implement user feedback
4. **Scale Preparation**: Optimize for increased user load
5. **Documentation**: Create user guides and training materials

## Conclusion

This implementation plan transforms our platform into a truly self-service educational ecosystem that:

1. **Eliminates teacher administrative burden**
2. **Empowers students and parents** with direct access
3. **Improves engagement** through mobile-first design
4. **Scales efficiently** without manual intervention
5. **Maintains security** while simplifying access

The phased approach ensures we can validate each component before moving forward, reducing risk while delivering value incrementally.

**Current Status**: Student portal optimization complete with enhanced dashboard, mobile-first navigation, and Tunisia timezone support. Now proceeding with teacher dashboard enhancements for group invitation system and student management features.

**Next Priority**: Implement group invitation UI with QR code generation to enable self-service student registration workflow.
